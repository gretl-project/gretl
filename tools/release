Remote:
* On sourceforge, make a new versioned subdirectory for gretl,
  and upload the source package as well as the per-platform
  binary packages. Upload a README. Use the SF File
  Manager to mark the new files as the default downloads.
* Also make a new versioned subdirectory of "addons" and
  upload the .zip addon files, if need be.
* Upload to the SF cgi-bin directory a text file named RELEASE
  containing the new version ID, e.g. "gretl-2021d"

* Update all the web docs (this is automated: ./update_html auto)
  and upload them to sourceforge
* Update the libgretl API docs and upload ("apipack")
* Send a message to gretl-announce
