Libtool 2.4.6 has escalated a non-absolute path in -rpath to a 
fatal error. Modified ltmain.sh to permit, for OS X, an -rpath
entry of the sort "@executable_path/..."

Also modified ltmain.sh to hush the "seems to be moved" and "has
been moved" warnings for .la files, which get to be extremely 
tedious when cross-compiling.
