regls example files

Please note that fatplus.inp, lambda_sequence.inp, xvalidate_consec.inp
and elnet_sequence.inp include comparison with R's glmnet. These scripts
contain the following lines (or similar):

# STOP here if R + glmnet is not available
# quit

You should uncomment the "quit" command to prevent an error if you
don't have R and glmnet installed.
