\title{\textsf{geoplot}: cartography in gretl}
\author{Allin Cottrell and Jack Lucchetti}
\date{February 28, 2024}

\maketitle

This document describes the \textsf{geoplot} addon package for gretl,
introduced in version 2020c. We have found it preferable, for reasons
of efficiency, to implement its core mapping functionality via
built-in functions, coded in C. For basic usage, therefore, it's not
necessary to load the package explicitly via ``\texttt{include
  geoplot.gfn}'', as one would usually expect for an addon.

Section~\ref{sec:quick} in this document is meant to give the reader a
quick introduction to the main cartographic features we offer. In
order to produce more refined maps, however, we provide more
specialized facilities that are explained in the rest of the document.

Section~\ref{sec:prelim} below covers some preliminaries which we hope
will help the reader understand the basics of cartography via
gretl. Section~\ref{sec:workflow} describes the basic workflow for
producing a map image. Section~\ref{sec:example} then provides a
simple worked example and section~\ref{sec:pairing} addresses a
potential stumbling block. Section~\ref{sec:opts} goes over in detail
the options to the core \texttt{geoplot} function;
section~\ref{sec:qualitative} discusses some spcifics of plotting
qualitative data; section~\ref{sec:gui} tells you what's available via
gretl's graphical interface; and section~\ref{sec:expert} explains
some ``expert'' refinements. Three appendices cover some technical
points that may be of interest to expert users.

\section{Quick start}
\label{sec:quick}

The sample file \texttt{us2020.geojson} contains the main results of
the 2020 presidential elections in the US. If you open it via the
command
\begin{code}
  open us2020.geojson --frompkg=geoplot
\end{code}
you will see a dataset that looks very much like an ordinary gretl
dataset:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrr}
\hline
   &          name &   region &         dem &    biden &      rep  \\ 
\hline                                                   
 1 &      Maryland &    South &      0.6536 &        1 &   0.3215  \\ 
 2 &     Minnesota &  Midwest &      0.5240 &        1 &   0.4528  \\ 
 3 &       Montana &     West &      0.4055 &        0 &   0.5692  \\ 
 4 &  North Dakota &  Midwest &      0.3178 &        0 &   0.6512  \\ 
 5 &        Hawaii &     West &      0.6373 &        1 &   0.3427  \\ 
 6 &         Idaho &     West &      0.3307 &        0 &   0.6384  \\ 
 % 7 &    Washington &     West &      0.5797 &        1 &   0.3877  \\ 
 % 8 &       Arizona &     West &      0.4936 &        1 &   0.4906  \\ 
 % 9 &    California &     West &      0.6348 &        1 &   0.3432  \\
\multicolumn{6}{c}{\vdots} \\  
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In fact this dataset is special, since it also contains cartographic
information ``in the background''. The question of how to create such
a file will be dealt with in Sections~\ref{sec:prelim} and
\ref{sec:workflow}, but for the moment let's just skip this point.

To plot a thematic map for the share of votes received by the
Republicans in each state, you could simply open a console and type
\begin{code}
geoplot(rep)
\end{code}
and a plot like the one shown in Figure~\ref{fig:us2020-rep}
should appear on your screen. Achieving the same via the GUI is quite
easy; we'll deal with this in Section~\ref{sec:gui}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{us2020-rep}
  \caption{Output of \texttt{geoplot(rep)}}
  \label{fig:us2020-rep}
\end{figure}

The interpretation of the map in Figure~\ref{fig:us2020-rep} should be
obvious, with ``hotter'' colors for the states where the Republican
party enjoyed more support, as shown by the legend to the right of the
map. If we try the same with the \texttt{region} variable via
\begin{code}
  geoplot(region)
\end{code}
we get a map similar to Figure~\ref{fig:us2020-reg}. In this case the
colors are the same for states in the same US region: note that the
format of the legend has also changed appropriately. The difference is
due to the fact that \texttt{rep} is a quantitative variable, while
\texttt{region} is qualitative (and string-valued). Gretl is aware of
the difference and plots the map with the appropriate adjustments. A
similar example that you can try by yourself is plotting a map for the
binary variable \texttt{biden}. More on this in
Section~\ref{sec:qualitative}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{us2020-reg}
  \caption{Output of \texttt{geoplot(region)}}
  \label{fig:us2020-reg}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{us2020-dem}
  \caption{Output of \dtk{geoplot(dem, _(palette="blues"))}}
  \label{fig:us2020-dem}
\end{figure}

Many details of the maps---such as their color scheme, size, and so
on---can be customized to the user's needs. To this aim, you can
supply an options bundle to the \cmd{geoplot} function to inflect
its behavior. For example, the line
\begin{code}
  geoplot(dem, _(palette="blues"))
\end{code}
produces something like Figure~\ref{fig:us2020-dem}. In this case, we
use the \texttt{palette} option to represent the degree of Democratic
support by shades of blue. The available options and their meaning are
explained in section~\ref{sec:opts}.

And now, let's take a deeper look under the hood.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}

Given gretl's user base and vocation, we assume that people will be
primarily interested in ``thematic'' maps, in which geographical areas
get different colors according to some variable of interest (for
example regions of a country are colored according to their
unemployment rates). Fancier maps are out of scope for the
present. From here on we'll simply refer to maps of this sort as
``maps'' and the geographical entities they contain (which may be
countries, states, counties, l\"ander or whatever) as
``regions''. Plotting a map typically involves drawing a number of
polygons, filled with appropriate colors, to some device (the screen,
or a file).

The essential ingredients for doing this are
\begin{enumerate}
   \item A geometrical description of the regions.
   \item The data for coloring the polygons.
   \item Appropriate software for producing the map.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The geometry}
\label{sec:geometry}

Let's say we have $n$ regions, indexed by $i$. Region $i$ is
represented geometrically as a collection of $k_i$ polygons (think
islands in an archipelago), indexed by $j$. Each polygon is defined by
$h_{i,j}$ coordinates. Typically, each coordinate vector has two
elements, latitude and longitude.

The information on each region has two components:
\begin{description}
\item[Metadata] At minimum this should include the region's
  identifier(s), as strings and/or numerical codes. Other information,
  such as land area, may also be included. You can think of this as a
  dataset with $n$ observations and several variables, possibly
  string-valued.
\item[Polygons] A representation of the region's shape on the map, in
  the form of one or more polygons, each taking the form of an array
  of X--Y pairs, typically latitude and longitude. You can think of
  this as an array of arrays of 2-column matrices: the outer array is
  of size $n$; inner array $i$ contains $k_i$ matrices, each with two
  columns.
\end{description}

Several file formats can be used for storing the geometry
information.\footnote{The site
\url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts}
offers a nice collection for European NUTS regions (NUTS =
Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics).}
Gretl supports what are probably the two most common formats:
\begin{itemize}
\item GeoJSON files: these are plain JSON files with an internal
  structure specified by RFC 7946. Such a file takes the form of an
  array of regions (or ``features''), with each element containing the
  metadata under the key \texttt{properties} and the polygons under
  the key \texttt{geometry}.
\item ESRI shapefiles: these come as collections of several files,
  usually zipped together. The essential components are an
  \textsf{xBase} file, with \texttt{dbf} extension, holding the
  metadata; the shapefile proper with extension \texttt{shp}, holding
  the polygons; and an index file with extension \texttt{shx}, used to
  speed up operations when reading the data. The website
  \url{https://gadm.org/} offers a huge collection of such files.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The payload data}
\label{sec:payload}

By ``payload'' we mean the data used for coloring the regions.  We
assume that the payload is available as a gretl series. This typically
means that the user has a data file (in native \texttt{gdt} format or
some other format gretl can read) in which each line represents a
region, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:payload}. Note in particular
the ``id'' column.  We assume that the map metadata contain sufficient
information to establish a correspondence with the dataset containing
the payload: either a numerical code or a suitable string-valued
variable.  One thing one quickly learns in exploring a variety of
\texttt{geojson} and \texttt{shp} files is that there's no telling how
the regions will be ordered; one \textit{cannot} assume that they
occur in what one might think of as ``standard'' order (e.g.\
alphabetical order for US states).

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llrr}
  %\hline
  id	& State & Pop2019 & Pop2010 \\
  \hline \\ [-1.75ex]
  1	& Alabama	& 4903185	& 4779736  \\
  2     & Alaska	& 731545	& 710231   \\
  101   & American Samoa	& 55641	& 55519	  \\
  3	& Arizona	& 6278717	& 6392017  \\
  4	& Arkansas	& 3017825	& 2915918  \\
  5	& California	& 39512223	& 37254523 \\
  6	& Colorado	& 5758736	& 5029196  \\
  7	& Connecticut	& 3565287	& 3574097  \\
                & \vdots & \\
  %\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Typical format for a payload dataset}
\label{tab:payload}
\end{table}

\subsection{The software backend}
\label{sec:software}

In principle one could represent maps using any one of the many
plotting libraries available, but gretl uses \textsf{gnuplot}, which
we already use for all other kinds of plot. Some insight into the
\textsf{gnuplot} commands we use can be gained from \ref{sec:gnuplot}.

Given the geometry data and the payload, writing a \textsf{gnuplot}
script for producing the map is straightforward. And in most cases
\textsf{gnuplot} can produce a plot in short order. You might have to
wait a little if there are many regions, of complex shapes,
represented in high precision in the source map file.

\section{The workflow}
\label{sec:workflow}

Typical workflow for producing a thematic map in gretl is likely to be
as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You \cmd{open} the map-datafile as a gretl dataset; this reads
  in the metadata so gretl's \dollar{nobs} will be equal to the number
  of regions, $n$.\label{item:open}
\item You add the payload data, via the \texttt{append} or
  \texttt{join} commands or in some other way.\label{item:join}
\item You decide on some details of your map (appearance, format,
  etc.), with sensible defaults being available.\label{item:look}
\item You create the map.\label{item:map}
\item Optionally, you can save the data in gretl's native \texttt{gdt}
  format (but see below).\label{item:save}
\end{enumerate}

Point \ref{item:open} is handled by using the \texttt{open} command on
the map-datafile. The filename extensions recognized for this purpose
are \texttt{json} or \texttt{geojson} for GeoJSON files, and
\texttt{dbf} or \texttt{shp} for ESRI shapefiles.\footnote{In
  principle we could read the polygons at this point and store them in
  RAM, but for now we don't. We just read in the metadata, but store
  the path to the associated geometry file internally.}
Point~\ref{item:join} is also handled by standard gretl commands.

Points \ref{item:look} and \ref{item:map} are handled by the
\texttt{geoplot} function, which can be called in either of two ways,
corresponding to these two signatures:
\begin{code}
function void geoplot(const series payload[null], const bundle options[null])

function void geoplot(string mapfile, const series payload[null],
                      const bundle options[null])
\end{code}
The first case is applicable if the map to be shown has already been
loaded as a gretl dataset. The second case is required if you want to
use a map file which has not been so loaded: then you need to give its
name. The \texttt{payload} argument is the (optional) series with
which to colorize the polygons, and \texttt{options} is an (optional)
bundle to contain one or more elements governing the appearance or
destination of the plot.
\begin{itemize}
\item If the \texttt{payload} argument is given as \texttt{null} or
  omitted then the map is drawn ``as is'', without any
  colorization. This can be useful if you just want to see what the
  polygons look like.
\item If the \texttt{options} bundle is omitted all options are set to
  their default values---which means, among other things, that you see
  the map on screen but nothing is saved. For full details on the
  available options see section~\ref{sec:opts}.
\end{itemize}

Note that once a map is loaded as a dataset you can retrieve its
filename using the \verb|$mapfile| accessor. This is convenient if you
wish to read the full content of the file (including the polygons) as
a bundle:
\begin{code}
bundle b = bread($mapfile)
\end{code}
%$
Finally, a cautionary note on point~\ref{item:save} above: the saved
\texttt{gdt} file will \emph{not} contain the geometry information,
but rather a pointer to the appropriate file (GeoJSON or
shapefile). As a consequence, as long as the file holding the polygon
info remains in the same place, you can simply re-open your
\texttt{gdt} file and create new maps. However, you can't send it to
someone else and expect it to work for map creation, unless you also
supply them with the original geometry file.

\section{An example}
\label{sec:example}

For this example we'll produce a map showing GDP per capita of the six
founder countries of the EU, using three files: script
\texttt{founders.inp}, data file \texttt{founders.csv} and map
\texttt{founders.geojson}. In this case the required files are small
enough to be readily inspected by hand.  The content of
\texttt{founders.csv}, which holds what will be the payload, is shown
in Listing~\ref{tab:founders-csv}.

\begin{script}[htbp]

     "FID": "FR"}, "id": "FR"},
  ...
\end{scode}
\caption{Excerpt of \texttt{founders.geojson}}
\label{tab:json-xrpt}
\end{script}

The JSON file is too big to show here in full but small enough to
examine in any text editor; listing~\ref{tab:json-xrpt} contains a
representative excerpt. Note that while Belgium is a single polygon
France is an array of polygons (``\texttt{MultiPolygon}''), because of
Corsica.

\begin{script}[htbp]
\begin{scode}
open founders.geojson --frompkg=geoplot

join founders.csv gdp pop --ikey=FID --okey=code
series gdppc = 1000*gdp/pop

opts = _(plotfile = "GDPpc.plt", inlined = 1)
geoplot(gdppc, opts)
\end{scode}
  %$
\caption{Content of \texttt{founders.inp}}
\label{tab:founders-script}
\end{script}

The \texttt{founders.inp} script is shown in
Listing~\ref{tab:founders-script}, and what we get after opening the
\texttt{geojson} file in gretl is in Listing~\ref{tab:founders-meta}.

\begin{script}[htbp]
\begin{scode}
     CNTR_NAME    ISO3_CODE      CNTR_ID    NAME_ENGL          FID

1     Belgique          BEL           BE      Belgium           BE
2       France          FRA           FR       France           FR
3  Deutschland          DEU           DE      Germany           DE

5    Luxemburg          LUX           LU   Luxembourg           LU
6    Nederland          NLD           NL  Netherlands           NL
\end{scode}
\caption{The ``founders'' metadata}
\label{tab:founders-meta}
\end{script}

Next, we perform a \cmd{join} operation with \texttt{FID} (from the
JSON file) as the inner key and \texttt{code} (from the CSV file) as
the outer key. Finally, we call the \cmd{geoplot} function to create
an on-screen map. We specify the \texttt{payload} to colorize and via
the \texttt{options} argument we add a couple of points: the
\textsf{gnuplot} input file should be saved under the name
\texttt{GDPpc.plt}, and the geometry data should be ``inlined'' in
this file, making it self-contained.

Running the script will produce a \textsf{gnuplot} file resembling the
following:

\begin{code}
set term wxt persist

unset key
set cbrange [33.3288:117.018]
set xrange [31.7826:51.4213]
set yrange [14.7701:36.0553]
$MapData << EOD
40.4036 30.79039 47.00315
40.59686 30.49366 47.00315

[...]

38.92268 31.40258 51.142806
38.59809 31.50169 51.142806
38.59737 31.60855 51.142806

EOD
plot for [i=0:*] $MapData index i with filledcurves fc palette, \
  $MapData using 1:2 with lines lc "white" lw 1
\end{code}
%$

and feeding the above into \textsf{gnuplot} yields the map shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:founders}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{GDPpc.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Output of \texttt{founders.inp} (default gnuplot palette)}

\end{figure}

\section{Ensuring correct alignment}
\label{sec:pairing}

In order to produce a correct map it is essential that everything be
aligned properly: the map metadata, the payload series, and the
geometries of the regions. ``Region $i$'' must have the same referent
in all three contexts.

If the source map (GeoJSON or shapefile) is not broken we can assume
that the original metadata and the geometries are indeed aligned
correctly. But problems may arise (a) in aligning the payload and (b)
if one wishes to exclude some regions from the map. We discuss these
issues in turn.

\subsection{Aligning the payload}

If the payload you wish to plot is already included in the map
metadata, there's no problem. But when the map data and the payload
come from different sources it may be tricky to get them aligned
properly. This problem is not specific to the mapping apparatus---it's
a more general issue concerning the matching of data from different
sources, addressed at length in the chapter titled ``Joining data
sources'' in the \GUG{}---but it may be helpful to offer a few
comments here.

As mentioned above, the relevant tools provided by gretl are
\texttt{append} and \texttt{join}. A simple \texttt{append} will work
only if the regions appear in the same order in the map and payload
datasets. This is fairly easily checked if the number of regions is
small and each dataset contains readily comparable
identifiers. Otherwise---if the orders clearly differ or it's hard to
tell---it will be necessary to use \texttt{join}.

Look back at Listing~\ref{tab:founders-script}. In that case the map
and payload datasets contained the same set of two-letter identifiers
for the countries---albeit under different names, \texttt{FID} and
\texttt{code}---so \texttt{join} using the \option{ikey} and
\option{okey} options worked fine. In a different case, however, the
respective identifiers may not match up. For example, region names
might be in English in one dataset and in, say, Italian in the
other. Then you'll have to exercise your intelligence, but one idea is
to create an intermediate ``Rosetta stone'' file, maybe as CSV, giving
the mapping between the two identifiers, as in:
\begin{code}
# rosetta.csv
ID_en,ID_it
Apulia,Puglia
Sardinia,Sardegna
...
\end{code}
Then you can \texttt{join} the Rosetta file to the map dataset, hence
adding the required identifier that's initially lacking.

\subsection{Sub-sampling}
\label{sec:sub-sample}

In some cases one may wish to leave out certain outlying regions. For
example, it's quite common to produce thematic maps of the USA that
omit Hawaii, and perhaps Alaska. In principle leaving out regions
threatens to break the required alignment of payload and geometry, but
this is handled as follows: if you sub-sample the map dataset using
the \texttt{smpl} command, \texttt{geoplot} automatically drops the
associated polygons from the plot.

This is illustrated in Listing~\ref{tab:USA}. Figure~\ref{fig:USA}
shows the results with and without exclusion of Alaska and
Hawaii.\footnote{Given the role of this example we don't bother adding
  a real payload, but just simulate data using the \texttt{normal}
  function.}

\begin{script}[p]
  \begin{scode}
open us-states.geojson --quiet --frompkg=geoplot
x = normal() # fake up some data!
opts = _(plotfile = "us0.plt", palette = "blues")

# show the entire USA
opts.title = "USA (complete)"
geoplot(x, opts)

# skip Alaska and Hawaii
smpl postal != "AK" && postal != "HI" --restrict
opts.title = "USA (mainland)"
opts.plotfile = "us1.plt"
geoplot(x, opts)
  \end{scode}
  \caption{US maps, complete vs contiguous states}
  \label{tab:USA}
\end{script}

A related case is where the payload value is missing (\texttt{NA}) for
one or more regions. Here you have a choice. By default, regions whose
payload is \texttt{NA} are shown in outline, not colored, but either
of two alternatives can be selected by passing a string under the key
\texttt{missvals} in the options bundle: if the value is \verb|"skip"|
the affected regions are omitted; if it's \verb|"fill"| they are
colored gray. (The value \verb|"outline"| may be given, confirming the
default.)

\section{Options for the \texttt{geoplot} function}
\label{sec:opts}

We first present all the currently supported options in alphabetical
order. Below the listing we give some further explanation of the usage
of \texttt{plotfile}, \texttt{show} and \texttt{inlined}.

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{border}:] boolean, show a rectangular border around the
  map. Default: true.
\item[\texttt{height}:] scalar, giving the height of the plot in
  pixels. Default: 600. Even if the desired output is a vector graphic
  (PDF or EPS) rather than a bitmap (see \texttt{plotfile} below),
  setting this value relative to the default can be used to adjust the
  size of the plot. For example \texttt{height = 400} will give a PDF
  graphic that's two-thirds of the default size.
\item[\texttt{inlined}:] boolean, to have the polygon data written
  directly into the \textsf{gnuplot} file. Default: false, the data
  are read from a separate file.
\item[\texttt{keypos}:] string, specifying the position of the key for
  discrete plot colors (relevant only when plotting qualitative data;
  see Section~\ref{sec:qualitative}).  This string must be a valid
  argument to gnuplot's \cmd{set key} command.  The most common usage
  takes the form of two words: \texttt{left}, \texttt{right} or
  \texttt{center} along with \texttt{top}, \texttt{bottom} or
  \texttt{center} (in either order). These words can be preceded by
  \texttt{outside} to place the key outside of the plot area. For
  example, \verb|keypos="bottom center"| or
  \verb|keypos="outside top left"|.  The default position is bottom
  right.
\item[\texttt{linecolor}:] string, naming the color in which to draw
  the borders of the regions. By default this is white if a payload is
  plotted, black if only outlines are shown.
\item[\texttt{linewidth}:] scalar, giving the width of the lines
  representing the borders of the regions. Setting this to 0
  suppresses those lines (unless no payload is supplied). Default:
  1.0.
\item[\texttt{literal}:] string containing \textsf{gnuplot} commands,
  for insertion before the actual \texttt{plot} command.
\item[\texttt{logscale}:] boolean, use log scale for the
  payload. Default: false.
\item[\texttt{missvals}:] string, see section~\ref{sec:sub-sample}.
\item[\texttt{plotfile}:] filename, allowing the user to direct
  output, either to a specified \textsf{gnuplot} command file or to a
  graphic file. If a command file is wanted the extension should be
  \texttt{plt}. If a graphic file is wanted you should give one of the
  following extensions: \texttt{png}, \texttt{pdf}, \texttt{eps},
  \texttt{emf}, \texttt{svg} or \texttt{html}.  If \texttt{plotfile}
  is given, but not as a full path, the file is written to the user's
  working directory.
\item[\texttt{projection}:] string, see~\ref{app:proj}.
\item[\texttt{palette}:] string, the exact specification of which
  depends on whether the payload data are quantitative or
  qualitative. For the qualitative case see
  Section~\ref{sec:qualitative}. In the quantitative case the string
  should give either a \textsf{gnuplot} \texttt{set palette} command
  or a predefined option, of which there are currently three:
  \texttt{blues}, \texttt{oranges} and \texttt{green-to-red}. For
  example, the syntax
  \begin{code}
    options.palette = "set palette defined (0 '#D4E4F2', 1 'steelblue')"
  \end{code}
  will give you a pleasing blue gradient---which also happens to be
  what you get by giving
  \begin{code}
    options.palette = "blues"
  \end{code}
  If no such string is given you get the default built-in
  \textsf{gnuplot} palette.
\item[\texttt{show}:] boolean, should the plot should be shown
  on-screen right away? Default: true. (Otherwise a file of some sort
  is written but not displayed---see \texttt{plotfile} above.)
\item[\texttt{tics}:] boolean, for turning on the printing of X
  (longitude) and Y (latitude) tics. Default: tics are suppressed,
  unless \texttt{geoplot} is invoked without any payload.
\item[\texttt{title}:] string specifying a title for the
  plot. Default: no title.
\item[\texttt{xrange}:] 2-element vector, containing the longitude
  range used on the plot (see \ref{sec:xyranges}). Default:
  automatically determined.
\item[\texttt{yrange}:] 2-element vector, containing the latitude
  range used on the plot (see \ref{sec:xyranges}). Default:
  automatically determined.
\end{description}

It may be helpful to run through various \texttt{geoplot} scenarios
with an eye to usage of the options.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You just want to see the map on-screen. Then don't give
  \texttt{plotfile} (or set it to \texttt{null}) and accept the
  default of \texttt{show} = 1.\label{just-see}
\item You want to see the map on-screen but also save the plot command
  file that generated it (maybe you want to edit the commands or pass
  them to \textsf{gnuplot} independently of gretl). Then specify
  \texttt{plotfile} with a \texttt{plt} extension.\label{see-and-save}
\item As in case 2 but you don't care to see the map on-screen: add
  \texttt{show} = 0.
\item You want to generate a graphic file (maybe for inclusion in a
  document or web page). Then give \texttt{plotfile} with one of the
  recognized graphic format extensions. In this case \texttt{show} is
  automatically turned off.
\end{enumerate}

Note that if you set \texttt{show} to 0 and do \textit{not} specify
\texttt{plotfile} that is tantamount to saying ``Don't do anything!'',
which is regarded as an error.

\subsection{Inlined data or not?}

As mentioned above, \texttt{geoplot} can pass the map coordinates to
\textsf{gnuplot} either by writing them directly into the plot command
file (\texttt{inlined} = 1), or by writing them to a separate data
file whose name is recorded in the command file (\texttt{inlined} =
0).

From the user's point of view, this distinction makes a difference
only if you're saving the plot command file (as in
scenario~\ref{just-see} or \ref{see-and-save} above).  In that
context, the advantage of having the data inlined is that, being all
in one file, the information required to generate a map cannot easily
become ``unstuck''. The disadvantage is that the command file may be
very large, and perhaps not so easy to edit; besides the actual
\textsf{gnuplot} commands it may contain many thousands of lines of
coordinates data (which in general \textit{should not be touched}, on
pain of breaking the map). At present \texttt{inlined} is set to
0 by default but that may change; we recommend making an explicit
choice via the \texttt{options} bundle.

Note that if you specify \texttt{plotfile} as a \textsf{gnuplot}
command file, but not \texttt{inlined}, you'll get two output files:
the specified \texttt{plt} file plus a data file named by adding the
extension \texttt{dat}. For example you might get \texttt{mygeo.plt}
and \texttt{mygeo.plt.dat}, while with \texttt{inlined} = 1 you'd just
get a big \texttt{mygeo.plt}.

\section{Quantitative versus qualitative payloads}
\label{sec:qualitative}

In the foregoing we have assumed that if a payload is supplied the
data are quantitative---either continuous, or if discrete then at
least ordinal. However, one may wish to plot qualitative (categorical)
data, and that calls for a different sort of color palette.  In the
quantitative case one probably wants a graduated scheme---either
shades of a single hue or perhaps a ``heat map'' comprising more than
one hue. If the data are categorical, clearly distinct colors are
likely wanted.

How can \texttt{geoplot} tell the difference? Well, in a gretl dataset
a categorical variable is likely represented by a string-valued
series, but may take the form of a numeric series where the numbers
are a pure encoding with no quantitative significance. String-valued
series (and also 0/1 dummy series) will be recognized by
\texttt{geoplot} as qualitative automatically, but otherwise a numeric
series called \texttt{cvals} which serves as an encoding should be
marked as such, using the command
\begin{code}
setinfo cvals --coded
\end{code}
If a payload series is recognized as qualitative with $k$ values, the
default \texttt{geoplot} palette is not the gnuplot default (which is
of the heat-map type) but rather an automatic selection of $k$
distinct colors. And the values accepted under the \texttt{palette}
key in the \texttt{options} bundle are simpler than in the
quantitative case. We expect either the name of an array of $k$
strings, each of which contains a color specification comprehensible
by \textsf{gnuplot}, or the keyword \texttt{auto} (which just confirms
automatic color selection). Here's an example, suitable for a binary
payload variable ($k=2$):
\begin{code}
strings mycolors = defarray("#D22532", "#244999")
opts.palette = "mycolors"
\end{code}
In addition a second, comma-separated element can be given when the
payload data are qualitative, namely an array of strings to appear in
the ``key'' or legend for the plot. If the payload series is
string-valued its strings will be used by default for this purpose,
but you may wish to supply abbreviated or translated strings. This
facility can also be used to give suitable strings for a 0/1 binary
series (which cannot have string values since that requires a minimum
numeric value of 1 or greater). Extending the example above, we might
do:
\begin{code}
strings mycolors = defarray("#D22532", "#244999")
strings zlabels = defarray("Republican", "Democratic")
opts.palette = "mycolors,zlabels"
\end{code}
The position of the legend can be adjusted by using the \cmd{keypos}
option (see Section \ref{sec:opts}).

Examples of maps showing qualitative data are provided by the scripts
\texttt{swiss-langs.inp} and \texttt{us-2020.inp}. You can find these
scripts and others via the item \textsf{Resource from addon} under the
\textsf{File} menu in the gretl GUI. Figure~\ref{fig:swiss} shows two
variants of a map representing the main language of each Swiss canton
(via a string-valued series named \texttt{mainlang}). The
customizations in the second map are achieved via
\begin{code}
strings langcolors = defarray("#E87E7E", "#9DA8E0", "#85E1C3", "#E1C385")
strings zlabels = defarray("Deutsch", "Français", "Rumantsch", "Italiano")
opts.palette = "langcolors,zlabels"
\end{code}
Give a palette string of (e.g.) \verb|"auto,zlabels"| if you want to
adjust the strings but use the default colors.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{swiss_langs1.pdf}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{swiss_langs2.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Main language per Swiss canton: the upper plot uses the
  default palette and strings; the lower one uses a customized palette
  and translated strings.}
\label{fig:swiss}
\end{figure}


\section{Maps via the GUI}
\label{sec:gui}

To this point we have referred exclusively to executing commands and
calling functions. You can, of course, execute commands and call
functions in the GUI program via script or via the gretl console, but
what about point-and-click? Well, there is a certain amount you can do
in that way.

First, you can open a shapefile or GeoJSON file using the menu item
\textsf{/File/Open data/User file}. In the bottom right-hand corner of
the ``open file'' dialog, use the pull-down list to select
``Shapefiles'' or ``GeoJSON files''. You can also drag-and-drop such
files onto the main gretl window to the same effect.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.333\textwidth]{geoplot_GUI.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Graphical interface to the \cmd{geoplot} command.}
\label{fig:gui}
\end{figure}
Once map metadata are loaded in this way, the option \textsf{Display
  map} becomes available via the context (``right-click'') menu in the
main window, and also under \textsf{/View/Graph specified vars};
it will trigger a window like the one in Figure~\ref{fig:gui}.

If the current dataset contains one or more series that seem to gretl to
be plausible ``payload'' variables,\footnote{Admittedly, the heuristic
  employed for this purpose is not terribly clever.} invoking
\textsf{Display map} will produce a dialog box that allows you to
select one, in which case you'll get a choice of color palette to
represent it. Otherwise you just get to view the map outlines.  The
options \texttt{border}, \texttt{linewidth}, \texttt{logscale} and
\texttt{height} (see Section~\ref{sec:opts}) can also be selected via
the GUI.

Further, the plot window shown by \textsf{Display map} offers a
right-click menu that allows saving the map (as PDF, EPS, PNG or EMF),
copying it to the clipboard, or saving it ``as an icon''.

Note that the options offered by the GUI are, at the moment, quite
limited compared to the ones available via scripting. We may at some
point expand the \textsf{Display map} dialog to offer more of the
choices available via the \texttt{options} argument to the
\texttt{geoplot} function.

\section{``Expert'' refinements}
\label{sec:expert}

To recap, we have explained how map metadata can be brought in via the
\texttt{open} command (or via the GUI); how to add ``payload'' data;
and how to generate a map using the \texttt{geoplot} function. So far
so good, but that leaves open some questions that might occur to
ambitious users.  Can I open a map file, add a payload series, and
save a modified version of the map file including the payload? And in
relation to a map of the USA (for example), is there a way to include
Alaska and Hawaii, but ``tuck them underneath'' the continental US,
like I see in graphics on the web?

Short answer: Yes. You can import a GeoJSON file (or shapefile) as a
gretl ``bundle'' by means of the \texttt{bread} function; make changes
to the bundle; then save it as GeoJSON using \texttt{bwrite}.

To get control over this it's necessary to understand the structure of
the bundle that \texttt{bread} produces when fed map input. This
mimics the structure of a GeoJSON file (even if the input comes from a
shapefile), as shown in Listing~\ref{tab:geojson}; the labeling of
elements is as in GeoJSON, with gretl types in parentheses.

\begin{script}[htbp]
\begin{scode}
FeatureCollection (bundle)
  features (array of n bundles)
    features[i] (bundle)
      features[i].properties (bundle)
      features[i].geometry   (bundle)
        features[i].geometry.type (string)
        features[i].geometry.coordinates (array)
\end{scode}
  \caption{Structure of map data, gretl types in parentheses}
  \label{tab:geojson}
\end{script}

\subsection{Injecting payload data}
\label{sec:inject}

First let's look at the case of injecting a payload series into a map
file. Listing~\ref{tab:add-gdp} revisits the EU founders map discussed
in section~\ref{sec:example}.  As before, we start by opening the
metadata and ``joining'' the GDP per capita data. But now we open the
GeoJSON as a bundle, and for each \texttt{feature} (country) we
augment its \texttt{properties} bundle with the corresponding value of
the \texttt{gdppc} series (under the key ``\texttt{gdppc}''). Finally,
we write the modified data to file.

\begin{script}[p]
\begin{scode}
open founders.geojson --quiet --frompkg=geoplot
join founders.csv gdp pop --ikey=FID --okey=code
series gdppc = 1000*gdp/pop

# open full GeoJSON as bundle
bundle b = bread($mapfile)

# add GDP per capita to properties
loop i=1..nelem(b.features)
   b.features[i].properties.gdppc = gdppc[i]
endloop

# save modified geojson file
bwrite(b, "founders_mod.json")
\end{scode}
  \caption{Adding payload data to a map file:
    \dtk{founders_mod.inp}}
  \label{tab:add-gdp}
\end{script}

\subsection{Rearranging regions}
\label{sec:rearrange}

Now how about rearranging regions of a given country (or more
generally, \texttt{features} within a given
\texttt{FeatureCollection})? Here we use the function
\dtk{geoplot_translate_feature}. Unlike the \texttt{geoplot}
function this is not ``built in'' so before calling it one must do
\begin{code}
include geoplot.gfn
\end{code}
The signature of the feature-translation function is
\begin{code}
void geoplot_translate_feature(bundle *b, int f,
                               matrix shift,
                               matrix center[null],
                               matrix scale[null])
\end{code}
You pass in a map bundle obtained via \texttt{bread} (in pointer
form); the sequential index, \texttt{f}, of the feature to translate;
and a 2-vector \texttt{shift} giving displacement in the X and Y
directions. If in addition you want to rescale the feature you pass
two more 2-vectors: \texttt{center} holds the coordinates of the
feature's centroid and \texttt{scale} the scale factors to apply in
the two directions.

An example script is shown in Listing~\ref{tab:translate} and the
result of plotting the modified GeoJSON file in
Figure~\ref{fig:usmod}. We obtain the second argument to pass to the
translator by inspection of the map dataset: Alaska is feature 48 and
Hawaii feature 5. In this case we decide to move Alaska 34\deg\
East and 35\deg\ South and shrink it substantially.  Getting the
effect one wants is likely to take some trial and error, but two
\textsf{geoplot} features can be helpful.

\begin{script}[p]
\begin{scode}
include geoplot.gfn

open us-states.geojson --quiet --frompkg=geoplot
bundle b = bread($mapfile)

# Shrink Alaska and place underneath the "lower 48"
matrix shift = {34, -35}
matrix center = {-150.885, 62.5503}
matrix scale = {0.3, 0.35}
geoplot_translate_feature(&b, 48, shift, center, scale)

# Shift Hawaii alongside Alaska
shift = {51, 5}
geoplot_translate_feature(&b, 5, shift)

# save modified geojson file
bwrite(b, "us_modified.json")
\end{scode}
  \caption{Moving Alaska and Hawaii}
  \label{tab:translate}
\end{script}

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{usmod.pdf}
  \caption{Alaska and Hawaii moved}
  \label{fig:usmod}
\end{figure}

First, if you plot just the map outlines (no payload) then you should
see the X and Y values on the axes, giving you at least a rough idea
of the shifts you might want. Second, \textsf{geoplot} contains the
function \dtk{geoplot_describe_json} which gives you a good deal
of relevant information. The signature of this function is
\begin{code}
bundle geoplot_describe_json (const bundle jb, int verbose[1])
\end{code}
You pass a map bundle and a verbosity level, as in
\begin{code}
include geoplot.gfn
bundle us = bread("us-states.geojson")
geoplot_describe_json(us, 3)
\end{code}
On searching the \texttt{verbose} = 3 output for Alaska one finds
(here's a small snippet):
\begin{code}
  48: geometry type = MultiPolygon, no id
        ...
        name: Alaska
        ...
        Extents: X = {-171.791,-129.98}; Y = {54.4042,70.6964}
\end{code}
The \texttt{Extents} data enable you to figure out plausible
values for the \texttt{center} of a feature.

\section{Coda}

In the foregoing we have mostly kept things simple with toy
examples. In concluding, we'll show off with a ``real'' example:
Figure~\ref{fig:ita-covid} shows the distribution of COVID cases
across Italian provinces as of 2020-05-15. The appearance of this plot
was tuned using the following option settings:

\begin{code}
string cmds = sprintf("set colorbox user origin 0.9,0.45 size 0.03,0.4\n")
cmds ~= sprintf("set xrange [6.4:20.5]")
bundle opts = _(plotfile = "covid.pdf")
opts.logscale = 1
opts.border = 0
opts.linewidth = 0.4
opts.palette = "green-to-red"
opts.literal = cmds
opts.height = 900
\end{code}

As you will have seen in the previous figures, the default
\textsf{gnuplot} ``colorbox'' is quite large, occupying the full
height of the plot.  This doesn't look so great for a tall, skinny
country like Italy, so we used the \texttt{literal} option to pass in
commands to make the colorbox smaller and reposition it; to prevent
the colorbox from going off the right edge of the plot we also made
the \texttt{xrange} a little wider than the default. We were able to
determine what the revised \texttt{xrange} should look like by
examining a plot with no payload, showing the latitude values on the
axes.

\begin{figure}[p]

\myappendix{Representation of polygons in gnuplot}
\label{sec:gnuplot}

The
following \textsf{gnuplot} code
\begin{code}
  unset key
  plot '-' using 1:2:3 with filledcurves fillcolor "blue"
  0 0 0
  0.5 0 0.866
  1 0 0
  e
\end{code}
produces an equilateral triangle: \includegraphics[height=2cm]{triangle.pdf}

\medskip

The internal coloring of polygons can be set using ``\texttt{fillcolor
  palette}''. For example,
\begin{code}
unset key
$coords << EOD
0 0 2.5
0 1 2.5
1 1 2.5
1 0 2.5

2 1 3.5
2 2 3.5
3 2 3.5
3 1 3.5

4 0 3
4 1 3
5 1 3
5 0 3
EOD
plot for [i=0:*] $coords index i with filledcurves fillcolor palette
\end{code}
(where the third column of the data indexes into the palette) produces
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{squares}
\end{center}

A nice way to customize the palette is via ``\texttt{set
  palette defined}'' (see the \textsf{gnuplot} manual; also see
section~\ref{sec:opts} above).

\clearpage
\myappendix{Projections}
\label{app:proj}

\textsf{Geoplot} assumes (mostly, but see below) that incoming map
coordinates are given as degrees of latitude (Y) and longitude
(X). This is mandated by RFC 7946, which has governed GeoJSON since
2016; it also appears to be the most common case for ESRI shapefiles.

Everyone knows that the Earth is not actually a sphere, but let's
pretend it is for simplicity. Then a degree of latitude is always the
same length on the ground: 1/360 of the planet's circumference. But
the length of a degree of longitude varies, from 1/360 of Earth's
circumference at the equator to zero at the poles. So imagine that we
pass the X--Y pairs to our plotting engine on the assumption that ``a
degree'' is always the same size: the result will be more or less OK
close to the equator but at higher or lower latitudes features will be
seriously stretched horizontally (or squashed vertically) relative to
what we're used to seeing. To avoid this effect some sort of
projection is required.

By default geoplot uses what we might call a ``quasi-Mercator''
projection. In most cases this should produce maps that look quite
acceptable and it has the advantage of simplicity. All we do is take
the height of the plot as specified by the user (or a default of 600
pixels) and figure out what the width should be to make a degree of
longitude the same size as a degree of latitude at the mid-point
latitude. However, we offer four alternatives, as follows:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cll}
    EPSG id & description & option string \\[4pt]
  \textsf{3857} & standard Mercator & \verb|"Mercator"| \\
  \textsf{4326} & ``null'' projection & \verb|"EPSG4326"| \\
  \textsf{2163} & U.S. National Atlas Equal Area &
     \verb|"EPSG2163"| \\
  \textsf{3035} & Europe Equal Area & \verb|"EPSG3035"|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Figure~\ref{fig:proj} compares the available projections for the
contiguous United States. In this case the default \textsf{geoplot}
projection and standard Mercator are practically
indistinguishable. \textsf{EPSG:4326}, which treats degrees as
everywhere the same size, exhibits the horizontal stretching mentioned
above. \textsf{EPSG:2163} gives the impression of looking at the USA
on a section of the globe.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{prj0.pdf} &
     \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{mercator.pdf} \\[-6pt]

  \end{tabular}
  \vspace{1ex}
  \caption{Comparison of projections}
  \label{fig:proj}
\end{figure}

To select one of the alternatives, you add the appropriate string to
the \texttt{options} bundle passed to the \texttt{geoplot} function
under the key \texttt{projection}. Please note that \textsf{EPSG:2163}
is specially tuned for the USA, and will produce weird-looking or
non-existent results for other parts of the world. \textsf{EPSG:3035}
is similarly tuned for Europe. They are both so-called Lambert
Azimuthal Equal Area projections.

\subsection*{Non-standard coordinates}

In certain map files---maybe GeoJSON predating RFC 7946, and perhaps
some shapefiles---the X--Y coordinates are not in the expected form of
degrees of latitude and longitude. In that case they probably already
encode some sort of projection, and so should not be ``re-projected''.
For GeoJSON files, \textsf{geoplot} makes an attempt to determine
whether a non-standard coordinate system is used, as was allowed under
the obsolete GeoJSON 2008 specification. In that case we automatically
cancel projection; we also do this if the X or Y values are out of
bounds for representing degrees (that is, |X| > 360 or |Y| > 180).

Failing such automatic detection, one can try specifying
\textsf{EPSG:4326} to get the X and Y units to be treated as equal in
size, in effect canceling projection, as in
\begin{code}
bundle options
options.projection = "EPSG4326"
\end{code}

\subsection*{Limiting the area shown}
\label{sec:xyranges}

Section~\ref{sec:sub-sample} explains how to exclude certain features
from a map using the \texttt{smpl} command. In some cases, however,
one may wish to limit what is shown in a different way, by specifying
ranges for latitude and longitude. This can be done by supplying
2-vectors in the \texttt{geoplot} options bundle under the keys
\texttt{xrange} (longitude) and \texttt{yrange} (latitude). For
example, to plot just the area from 40\deg\ to 60\deg\ North and
10\deg\ to 30\deg\ East you can do
\begin{code}
options.yrange = {40,60}
options.xrange = {10,30}
\end{code}
Specifying such ranges in degrees works fine if you are using the
default \texttt{geoplot} projection, Mercator or \textsf{EPSG:4326}.
But it doesn't work for azimuthal projections, where neither meridians
nor parallels are straight lines. Rather, you should first plot the
entire map using the projection you want, with axis tics turned on to
show the linearized coordinates. Then specify the ranges in terms of
these values. For example, here's how one might restrict a US map to
the contiguous states via ranges:
\begin{code}
open us-states.geojson --frompkg=geoplot
bundle opts
opts.projection = "EPSG2163" # azimuthal
opts.tics = 1
# take a look-see
geoplot(null, opts)
# suitable ranges, by inspection
opts.xrange = {-330,410}
opts.yrange = {-350,130}
geoplot(null, opts)
\end{code}

For anyone wishing to follow up on this sort of thing, there are many
websites presenting information on coordinate systems and
projections. Two of the most useful ones, in our experience, are:

\myappendix{Specialized functions}
\label{app:special}

The functions shown below are implemented in hansl and included in the
\textsf{geoplot} addon; to use them you must first do
\begin{verbatim}
include geoplot.gfn
\end{verbatim}

\begin{funcdoc}
\begin{verbatim}
bundle geoplot_describe_json (const bundle jb, int verbose[1])
\end{verbatim}
  Provides a systematic description of the GeoJSON bundle \texttt{jb},
  the amount of detail depending on the \texttt{verbose} setting,
  which has a maximum of 3. By assigning the return value one can
  obtain a bundle containing the information but for some purposes the
  printed output may suffice. See section~\ref{sec:rearrange}.
\end{funcdoc}

\begin{funcdoc}
\begin{verbatim}
void geoplot_set_properties (bundle *b, list L)
\end{verbatim}
  Rewrites the \texttt{properties} within the bundle representation of
  a map, \texttt{b}, to include all and only the series referenced in
  the list \texttt{L}. This provides a means of adding ``payload''
  data (see section~\ref{sec:payload}) and also pruning unwanted
  metadata.  In the example below, \texttt{us-states.geojson}
  originally contains 40 items of metadata per state, most of them
  unlikely to be of interest.
\begin{code}
# example
open us-states.geojson --quiet --frompkg=geoplot
join statepop.gdt population --ikey=postal --okey=Code

# select only the properties we actually want
list L = name postal population
bundle b = bread($mapfile)
geoplot_set_properties(&b, L)
bwrite(b, "us_pruned.json")
\end{code}
\end{funcdoc}

\begin{funcdoc}
\begin{verbatim}
void geoplot_translate_feature (bundle *b, int f,
                                matrix shift,
                                matrix center[null],
                                matrix scale[null])
\end{verbatim}
  Shifts the feature with sequential index \texttt{f}, optionally
  rescaling it. See section~\ref{sec:rearrange} for an example and
  explanation.
\end{funcdoc}

\begin{funcdoc}
\begin{verbatim}
matrix geoplot_seek_feature(const bundle b,
                            string name,
                            bool do_plot[1])
\end{verbatim}
  Searches the map bundle \texttt{b} for features matching
  \texttt{name} (on a case-insensitive basis). If one or more matches
  are found their 1-based indices are returned in a row vector.  If a
  single match is found metadata for the feature are printed and if
  \dtk{do_plot} is not set to zero a plot of the feature is
  shown.
\begin{code}
include geoplot.gfn
open us-states.geojson --frompkg=geoplot --quiet
map = bread($mapfile)
# no matches
geoplot_seek_feature(map, "nowhere")
# two matches
geoplot_seek_feature(map, "CAROLINA")
# one match, plot shown
geoplot_seek_feature(map, "Florida")
\end{code}
\end{funcdoc}

\begin{funcdoc}
\begin{verbatim}
void geoplot_simplify(bundle *b, scalar preserve[0.1:1:0.75])
\end{verbatim}
  Simplifies the polygons in the map bundle \texttt{b} using the
  Visvalingam--Whyatt algorithm.\footnote{See
    \url{https://hull-repository.worktribe.com/output/459275}. And for
    a nice illustration see \url{https://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/}
    (accessed 2023-01-16).}  This may be useful if for a certain
  geography of interest the only map file readily available is at a
  higher resolution than you need. Smaller values of the
  \texttt{preserve} parameter preserve less detail or in other words
  simplify the map more radically; the default value of 0.75 may be
  considered conservative if you start with a very detailed map.
\begin{code}
include geoplot.gfn
open highres.geojson --quiet
bundle map = bread($mapfile)
geoplot_simplify(&map, 0.5)
bwrite(map, "simplified.geojson")
open simplified.geojson --quiet
# see if the level of detail is OK
geoplot()
\end{code}
\end{funcdoc}
