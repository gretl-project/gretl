<h1>gretl and X-12-ARIMA</h1>
</center>

<p>X-12-ARIMA is the program currently used by the U.S. Census Bureau
for seasonal adjustment.  The home page for this program is at <a
  href="http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/">www.census.gov</a>.
Please look there for documentation and details.</p>

<p>Various packages are available that bundle X-12-ARIMA for use with gretl.
See the main <a href="../index.html">gretl page</a> for download details.
</p>

<p>Support for X-12-ARIMA has been available since version 1.0.2 of gretl 
(December 2002) and currently has three aspects.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>In the gretl GUI, you can call for an X-12-ARIMA analysis of a quarterly 
or monthly time series.  The seasonal, trend/cycle and irregular components
can be graped and/or saved to the dataset.
</p></li>

<li><p>In gretl's <kbd>arma</kbd> command there is an option to use X-12-ARIMA.
(The default is to use native gretl code.)  
</p></li>

<li><p>In current gretl CVS there is a function, <kbd>deseas</kbd>, which can
be used to produce a seasonally adjusted series via X-12-ARIMA.
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The following screenshots illustrate the first of these features.</p>

<p>After opening a suitable data set (i.e. containing seasonal time
series), select a variable in the gretl main window and pull down the
Variable menu.  Select "X-12-ARIMA analysis".</p>

<p>You will then see a dialog box which gives you the choice of saving
(into the current gretl data set) up to three of the series generated
by X-12-ARIMA, namely the seasonally adjusted version of the input
series, the estimated trend/cycle component of the series, and the
estimated "irregular" component.  At this point you can also choose
whether or not to display a graph showing these series.</p>

<p>If you choose to display the graph, you should see something like
this:</p>

<p>Besides saving output series and displaying the graph, you will
also see the full output from the X-12-ARIMA analysis.  An excerpt
from this is shown below.</p>
