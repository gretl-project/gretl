<h1>X-12-ARIMA</h1>

<p>The home page for this program is at <a
  href="http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/">www.census.gov</a>.
Please look there for documentation and details.</p>

<p>If you wish to install X-12-ARIMA for use with gretl under
  <b>GNU/Linux</b> you can</p>

<ul>
<li>Compile the source yourself, in which case 
I suggest running the shell script
  <kbd>x12arima.sh</kbd>.   This is supplied in the gretl source
  package; you can also <a href="x12arima.sh.txt">view it</a> or <a
  href="./x12arima.sh">download it</a> from here.  This script
  downloads the necessary files, makes some slight modifications that
  are needed for compilation under Linux, compiles the program (for
  this you need the GNU Fortran compiler, <kbd>g77</kbd>), and installs
  it in a location of your choice.</p> <li>Install a binary rpm
package, <a
href="ftp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/x12a-0.2.10-1.i386.rpm">x12a-0.2.10-1.i386.rpm</a>
(this package was built on Red Hat Linux 7.3).  
</ul>


<p>If you wish to use X-12-ARIMA with gretl on <b>Windows</b>, you
should download the self-installer, <a
  href="ftp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/x12a_install.exe">x12a_install.exe</a>
  and run it.  You will be prompted for an installation directory, by
  default <kbd>c:\userdata\x12arima</kbd>.  This package contains
  the program <kbd>x12a.exe</kbd> in win32 console form, along with
  examples and documentation in PDF format.  I am grateful to Brian
Monsell, at the Statistical Research Division of the U.S. Census
Bureau, for permission to redistribute X-12-ARIMA in this form.</p>

<h1>gretl and X-12-ARIMA</h1>

<p>Support for X-12-ARIMA is new in version 1.0.2 of gretl and at
present it is quite limited, but if there is interest in this feature
I will probably aim to develop it further.  The following pictures
illustrate what you can do as of now.</p>

<p>After opening a suitable data set (i.e. containing seasonal time
series), select a variable in the gretl main window and pull down the
Variable menu.  Select "X-12-ARIMA analysis".</p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="x12a-menu.png" ALT="Variable menu">
</center>

<p>You will then see a dialog box which gives you the choice of saving
(into the current gretl data set) up to three of the series generated
by X-12-ARIMA, namely the seasonally adjusted version of the input
series, the estimated trend/cycle component of the series, and the
estimated "irregular" component.  At this point you can also choose
whether or not to display a graph showing these series.</p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="x12a-dialog.png" ALT="Dialog box">
</center>

<p>If you choose to display the graph, you should see something like
this:</p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="x12a-graph.png" ALT="x12a graph">
</center>

<p>Besides saving output series and displaying the graph, you will
also see the full output from the X-12-ARIMA analysis.  An excerpt
from this is shown below.</p>

<h1>TRAMO and SEATS</h1>

<p>The home page for these programs is at <a
href="http://www.bde.es/servicio/software/econome.htm">www.bde.es</a></p>

<p>If you wish to install TRAMO/SEATS for use with gretl under
  <b>GNU/Linux</b> I suggest running the shell script
  <kbd>tramo_install.sh</kbd>.   This is supplied in the gretl source
  package; you can also <a href="tramo_install.sh.txt">view it</a> or <a
  href="./tramo_install.sh">download it</a> from here.  This script
  downloads the necessary files (Linux binaries and documentation --
  no source code is available), decompresses them, and installs them 
  it in a location of your choice.</p>

<p>DOS version download (<a
href="http://www.bde.es/servicio/software/tramo/dos.exe">dos.exe</a>).</p>
