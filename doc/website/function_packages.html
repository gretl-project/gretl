<h1>Gretl function packages: an overview</h1>
</center>

<p>
Function packages, written in gretl's scripting language
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/manual/hansl-primer.pdf">hansl</a>,
extend the program's functionality in numerous econometric domains,
including time-series methods, univariate and multivariate;
microeconometric methods; panel-data estimators and tests; Bayesian
methods, including VARs and model averaging; marginal effects for
nonlinear models; and specialized plotting methods. As of this writing
over 170 such packages are available.</p>

<p>There are two types of packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Addons: these <q>official</q> packages are written by members
    of the gretl team.  While gretl offers no warranty, the addons are
    tested as thoroughly as the core gretl code. They are supplied in
    the packages we provide for MS Windows and macOS, and also in the
    packages for Linux prepared
    by <a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gretl">Debian</a>
    and <a href="https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/gretl/">Fedora</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>Contributed packages: these are written by gretl users who
  may or may not be team members. They are moderated by the team, to
  ensure that they <q>work</q> (that is, produce plausible output when
  called as per their documentation), that they are reasonably
  well documented, and that they are non-redundant (don't just
  replicate functionality that's already available).
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Contributed packages are not installed automatically with the rest
  of gretl. You can install them from the GUI program: go to the menu
  item <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">File/Function
  packages/On server</span> to see a listing of what's available.
</p>

<p>You can browse the gretl
  addons <a href="https://gretl.sourceforge.net/addons-data/addons.xml">here</a>
  and the contributed
  packages <a href="https://gretl.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/gretldata.cgi">here</a>.
  In both cases package documentation is available online.
</p>

<p>
  Gretl users who are familiar with hansl are welcome to contribute
  packages. There's
  a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/manual/pkgbook.pdf">comprehensive
  document</a> explaining how to this and also, thanks to the late
  Stefano Fachin, a nice
  <a href="https://gretl.sourceforge.net/gfnguide/gfn_for_dummies.html">quick
    guide</a>.
