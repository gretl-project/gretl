<h1>Gretl function packages: an overview</h1>
</center>

<p>
Function packages, written in gretl's scripting language
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/manual/hansl-primer.pdf">hansl</a>,
extend the program's functionality in numerous econometric
domains.
</p>

<p>There are two types of packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Addons: these <q>official</q> packages are written by members
    of the gretl team.  While gretl offers no warranty, the addons are
    tested as thoroughly as the core gretl code. They are supplied in
    the packages we provide for MS Windows and macOS, and also in the
    packages for Linux prepared
    by <a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gretl">Debian</a>
    and <a href="https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/gretl/">Fedora</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>Contributed packages: these are written by gretl users who
  may or may not be team members. They are moderated by the team, to
  ensure that they <q>work</q> (that is, produce plausible output when
  called as per their documentation), that they are reasonably well
  documented, and that they are non-redundant (don't just replicate
  functionality that's already available). As of this writing over 170
  such packages are available. Some packages can only be used via the
  command line, but many of them also include a GUI <q>hook</q> (that
  is, offer to insert a menu item from which they can be called via a
  dialog box).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
Some examples of the extra features provided by addons and packages
include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>
      Assorted statistical methods: correspondence analysis,
      multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, CUB models, weighted
      statistics; additional tests (Bartlett, Friedman,
      Kruskal-Wallis, Kolmogorov-Smironv, Levene).
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Bayesian methods: Bayesian regression, Bayesian VARs, Bayesian
      Model Averaging.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Causal inference: matching estimators.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Additional tools for univariate models: multipliers for ARDL
      models, time-varying parameters, spatial regression, threshold
      models, Bai-Perron structural breaks, marginal effects for nonlinear
      models, Box-Cox modelling, extra utilities for IV estimation.
  </p></li>
  <li><p> Microeconometric methods: <b>probit models with
      heteroskedasticity and IV</b>, ROC curve and specification tests
      for binary models, discrete choice models, predictions for
      Tobit, ordered, count data models.
  </p></li>
  <li><p> Machine learning tools: <b>Regularized least squares (LASSO,
      RIDGE, Elastic Net)</b>, adaptive and graphical LASSO, k-means
      clustering, random forests.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Time series:
      <ul>
	<li><p>
	    Univariate: time series filters (Christiano-Fitzgerald,
	    Hamilton), Harvey-style structural models, additional unit
	    root tests (including Phillips-Perron and HEGY), FM-OLS,
	    SETAR models.
	</p></li>
	<li><p> Multivariate: <b>Structural VARs</b>, recursive VARs, Dynamic
	    Factor Models (also hierarchical), multivariate spectra,
	    Markov-switching VARs, bootstrap-based cointegration
	    tests.
	</p></li>
	<li><p>
	    Financial: Automated data downloading from Yahoo Finance,
	    <b>univariate GARCH</b> and SV models, DCC and BEKK multivariate models.
	</p></li>
	<li><p>
	    Forecasts: Forecats evaluations, Diebold-Mariano test,
	    interval forecasts.
	</p></li>
      </ul>
  </p></li>
  <li><p> Models for panel data: <b>IV models</b>, dynamic binary
      models, FE Poisson, Pooled and Mean Group estimator for dynamic
      models, RE Tobit, cross-sectional tests, unit-root and
      cointegration tests.
  </p></li>
  <li><p> Specialized plotting methods: <b>geographical maps</b>,
      candlesticks, heamaps, scatterplots with factor separation,
      bivariate and factorized densities.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Various utilities for Hansl programming. 
  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Entries in boldface are provided via addons, and are therefore
  immediately available upon successful installation on most
  platforms.
</p>
  
<p>Contributed packages are not installed automatically with the rest
  of gretl. You can install them from the GUI program: go to the menu
  item <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">File/Function
  packages/On server</span> to see a listing of what's available.
</p>

<p>You can also browse the gretl addons
  online <a href="https://gretl.sourceforge.net/addons-data/addons.xml">here</a>
  and the contributed
  packages <a href="https://gretl.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/gretldata.cgi">here</a>.
  In both cases you can access documentation for the packages.
</p>

<p>
  Gretl users who are familiar with hansl are welcome to contribute
  packages. There's
  a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/manual/pkgbook.pdf">comprehensive
  document</a> explaining how to this and also, thanks to the late
  Stefano Fachin, a nice
  <a href="https://gretl.sourceforge.net/gfnguide/gfn_for_dummies.html">quick
    guide</a>.
