<h2>Getting gretl</h2> 

<p>You have a choice of the latest "official" release or the current
"snapshot".  The snapshot is more up to date: often it will contain
bug-fixes but sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs. To see
what's new in the snapshot, take a look at the gretl
<a href="../ChangeLog.html">Change log</a> (the "in progress" entry).</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: If you're updating your gretl installation it may
  be advisable to delete the old version of gretl before
  installing the new one.</p>

<h2>Installing gretl</h2> 

<p>
1. Click to download either the latest release or the "snapshot".  The
selected gretl file should appear in your Downloads after a short
while.  Once the download is complete, minimize your browser window so
you can see what's happening on your computer.
</p>

<p>
2. Double-click on the gretl file in Downloads to open the installer.
You should then be walked through the installation process.
</p>

<p>
3. Navigate to Applications in the Finder and you should now see a gretl
icon there. Double-clicking should start gretl. On its first run gretl
may take a while to start, as it scans the fonts available on your
system. If gretl starts OK, you can drag its icon from Applications
onto the dock to get a quick-launcher.
</p>

<p>5. Finally, clean up. The installer (<kbd>pkg</kbd>) file can
be moved to the Trash once installation is completed.</p>

<p><b>Note on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and higher</b>: You may
  find that the OS rejects the installation, or
  won't let the program run, on the grounds that gretl "was not
  downloaded from the Mac App Store". This is not hard to
  fix. There's a good discussion with
  screenshots <a href="http://rampagedev.wordpress.com/os-x-tweaks/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-was-not-downloaded-from-the-mac-app-store-fix-2/">here</a>,
  but just in case that link goes bad here's the short version:</p>

<p>1. Open System Preferences.</p>

<p>2. Under the Personal tab, select the item named "Security &amp;
    Privacy".</p>

<p>3. Go to the General tab and unlock the menu (the little padlock
    marked "Click the lock to make changes").</p>

<p>4.Under the section "Allow applications downloaded from"
    select <b>Anywhere</b>.</p>

<h2>Trouble?</h2>

<p>Briefly, if you want to debug a non-functioning gretl on OS X, please try
this: open a Terminal window and run the following command:</p>

<pre>
/Applications/Gretl.app/Contents/MacOS/gretl.sh
</pre>

<p>This should give you some feedback on what is going wrong.</p>

<h2>Optional extras</h2>

<p>You may wish to install X-13-ARIMA-SEATS and/or TRAMO/SEATS. These are specialized programs for
analysis of seasonal time series data, in 64-bit macOS versions compatible with gretl. They
can be installed via the "gretl console" in the GUI program; just type the
following commands, respectively:</p>
<pre>
pkg install x13as-mac64.tar.gz
pkg install tramo-seats-mac64.tar.gz
</pre>
