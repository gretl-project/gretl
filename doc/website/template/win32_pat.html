<h1>Gretl: Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library</h1>
<h2>MS Windows version</h2>
</center>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>gretl for Windows comes in the form of a self-extracting executable,
<a
href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gretl/gretl-VERSION.exe">gretl-VERSION.exe</a>
(SHORTDATE, about 9MB). Just download and run this: you will be
prompted for the location to install the program (the default is
<kbd>c:\Program Files\gretl</kbd>).  The program has mostly been tested on 
Windows XP; it should work OK on all NT-based versions of Windows 
(that is, NT4, 2000, XP or Vista; but not Win9X or Windows ME).</p>

<p>The link above is to the latest official release.  Another possibilility
is to download the current "snapshot" of gretl:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/snapshots/gretl_install.exe/download">gretl_install.exe</a>.
This is likely to be somewhat more up to date: sometimes it will contain 
bug-fixes, and sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs!  
Translations into languages other than English are likely to be
incomplete.  What's new in the snapshot?  Take a look at the 
<a href="../ChangeLog.html">Change log</a> (the "in progress" entry).</p>

<p>If you want to run gretl on older versions of Windows you can
use 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/gretl/gretl-1.6.5.exe/download">version 1.6.5</a> 
of the program (requires Windows 98 or higher).</p>

<p>Optional extras you may wish to install:</p>

<p>The above are all self-extracting installers.  You must install gretl before installing
the extra items.</p>

<p>The executables were cross-compiled under GNU/Linux using <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/">mingw32</a> and <a
href="http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html">GTK for
Windows</a> (thanks Tor Lillqvist!). The free installer program is courtesy of <a
href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/">Jordan Russell</a>.</p>

<h2>Support for multiple languages</h2>

<p>Besides English, gretl supports French, Italian, Spanish, German,
Basque, Portuguese, Polish, Turkish and Russian.  Normally it shouldn't be necessary 
to do anything special to get gretl to appear in the local language: 
the program comes with the full set of translations, and they should 
be used automatically, based on the language setting of your computer.  In some
circumstances, however, it may be necessary to adjust your language
setting to achieve the expected effect.  This can be done
in the Windows control panel.</p>

<h2>Updating gretl</h2>

<p>When updating an existing installation of gretl, it's a good
idea to first run the uninstaller program
<kbd>unins000.exe</kbd>, which you should find in the main gretl
folder.  This will ensure that you don't get odd behavior due to
"stale" DLLs or Windows registry settings.  Note that running the
uninstaller will not touch any files you have created in the
<kbd>gretl/user</kbd> folder, but it will erase any customizations
you have made using the Preferences menu so you'll have to
re-establish these when you start the new version of the program.</p>

<h2>Running gretl over a network</h2>

<p>There's a page of advice <a href="./gretl_network.html">here</a> 
for anyone wanting to configure gretl for Windows to be run over a network, 
as in a computer lab setting.</p>

<h2>Building gretl for Windows</h2>

<p>If you want to build gretl for Windows yourself, download the gretl
source package (go <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/">here</a> to find the
latest one) and take a look in the <kbd>win32</kbd> sub-directory.
You will find there a Makefile for the Windows version: it is actually
designed for cross-compiling gretl on Linux but it shouldn't be too
hard to modify it for building on Windows, particularly if you're
using the mingw32 compiler.</p>
