<h2><a name="finding">Finding the repository on sourceforge</a></h2>

<p>Go to the gretl <q>project page</q> at
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/</a>
and select the <kbd>Code</kbd> item on the taskbar.</p>

<h2><a name="getting">Getting a copy</a></h2>

<p>Following on from the above: if you are not logged in you will see
an instruction by means of which you can grab a <i>read-only</i> copy of the
gretl-git sources, namely</p>

<pre>
  git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/gretl/git gretl-git
</pre>

<p>If you are logged in under your sourceforge <tt>USERNAME</tt>,
and you have write privileges with git, you should see an instruction
for getting a <i>read-write</i> copy, on the pattern</p>

<pre>
  git clone ssh://USERNAME@git.code.sf.net/p/gretl/git gretl-git
</pre>

<p>These are shell commands. Obviously, if you need access to update
  translations you must use the second command.</p>

<h2><a name="personal">Your personal git info</a></h2>

<p>Before doing anything substantive with <kbd>git</kbd> you should
  ensure that your basic personal information (name and email address)
  is known to the program. This can be done via two shell
  commands on the pattern:</p>

<pre>
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "yourname@yourserver.ext"
</pre>

<p>As you might guess, the above commands will set username and email
  for any and all git repositories on your local machine, If you wish
  to set specific data for gretl commits, then change directory to
  your copy of the gretl-git repository and issue commands on
  the pattern above but omitting the <kbd>--global</kbd> option.
  </p>

<h2><a name="update">Updating your copy</a></h2>

<p>The <kbd>git</kbd> command to update your copy of the source is</p>

<pre>
  git pull
</pre>

<p>So, very straightforward.</p>

<h2><a name="commit">Committing a change</a></h2>

<p>Having made a change that you wish to commit, you can do</p>

<pre>
  git commit &lt;filenames&gt;
</pre>

<p>to register changes to a specific file or files, or</p>

<pre>
  git commit -a
</pre>

<p>to commit any and all changes you have made. However, please
  note that in git the &ldquo;commit&rdquo; action does <i>not</i>
  upload your changes to the remote server (sourceforge). To
  do that you need add a &ldquo;push&rdquo;:</p>

<pre>
  git push
</pre>

<h2><a name="revert">Reverting local changes</a></h2>

<p>This information is relevant only for gretl developers, who are in the
business of making changes in the gretl code-base. It may happen from
time to time (I speak from experience!) that you make some changes in
your local copy of the gretl git sources and then decide (before committing)
that some of these changes are ill advised, and you want to roll them
back. One way of doing this is:
</p>

<pre>
  git checkout .
</pre>

<p>This will revert changes to files that are already <q>tracked</q> by git
(known to be part of the code base) but not already <q>staged</q> (set up
for a push via the <kbd>git commit</kbd> command).</p>

<p>To revert local changes that you have <i>already committed/staged</i> but not
yet pushed, there are two variants:</p>

<pre>
git reset --soft HEAD~
git reset --hard HEAD~
</pre>

<p>The first of these just <q>uncommits</q> the change, but does not revert the
state of your local files to HEAD. The second both uncommits the changes and
reverts your local files (or in other words, <q>nukes</q> your changes altogether).
</p>

<p>For a lot more on reverting changes, see
  <a href="https://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git">this
  GitHub blog entry</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="diffs">Looking at diffs</a></h2>

<p>To see any updates in your working copy relative to the
sourceforge repository, it's simple:</p>

<pre>
git diff
</pre>

<p>To inspect differences for a specific file, append the name of the file
to this command.</p>

<p>To see any updates made in the sourceforge repository relative to your
working copy:<p>

<pre>
git fetch origin
git diff HEAD origin/master
</pre>

<p>Note that unlike <kbd>pull</kbd>, a <kbd>fetch</kbd> doesn't actually
modify the files in your working copy, it just grabs information about
  what has changed in the repo.</p>

<p>Now suppose you've done a <kbd>commit</kbd> in your working copy
  but haven't yet (maybe inadvertently) done a <kbd>push</kbd>: how
  can you tell how your working copy differs from what's at
  sourceforge? Plain <kbd>git diff</kbd> won't do the job, but it's
  not so difficult:</p>

<pre>
git diff origin/master
</pre>

<p>If you just want an overview of which files differ between two
  branches, here's a good way:</p>

<pre>
git diff --stat --color someBranch..otherBranch
</pre>

<h2><a name="history">Examining history</a></h2>

<p>To see a simple record of the commits to an individual file you can
do:</p>

<pre>
  git log -- filename
</pre>

<p>Or if you want to see what exactly was changed at each commit, in
  the form of a patch, do:</p>

<pre>
  git log -p -- filename
</pre>

<h2><a name="branch">Branching</a></h2>

<p>To create a new branch, and then switch onto it:</p>

<pre>
git branch newbranch
git checkout newbranch
</pre>

<p>or use this shortcut: <kbd>git checkout -b newbranch</kbd>.</p>

<p>To push a new branch upstream and set up tracking:</p>

<pre>
git push -u origin newbranch
</pre>

<p>To switch back to <kbd>master</kbd> locally:</p>

<pre>
git checkout master
</pre>

<p>To merge <kbd>newbranch</kbd> into <kbd>master</kbd>:</p>

<pre>
git checkout master
git merge newbranch
</pre>

<p>To delete <kbd>somebranch</kbd>:</p>

<pre>
git branch -d somebranch
</pre>

<p>and to delete it upstream too:</p>

<pre>
git push origin --delete somebranch
</pre>

<h2><a name="branch-clean">Cleaning up unused branches</a></h2>

<p>When branching has been going on for some time, you may end up
with references to defunct branches in your local copy: branches
that were at one time active at &ldquo;origin&rdquo; but have since been
merged and/or deleted. How to get rid of these dangling references?
Fairly simple, though not totally easy to remember:</p>

<pre>
git remote prune origin
</pre>

<h2><a name="stash">Stashing local changes</a></h2>

<p>Stashing is particularly useful if you want to pull from the remote
repository but have changes in your working copy that are not committed,
and you don't really want to commit them yet. The command
<kbd>git stash</kbd> will save your changes out of harm's way. If and
when you're ready to revive those changes you can do:</p>

<pre>
git stash pop
</pre>

<p>to pull the last-stashed changes out of the stack and apply them to your
working copy. There are lots of other possible stash actions, the most
common probably being <kbd>git stash list</kbd> for a summary of what's
in the stash and <kbd>git stash show</kbd> for details.</p>

<h2><a name="windows">Using git on MS Windows</a></h2>
